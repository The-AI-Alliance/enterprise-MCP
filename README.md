The rest of this README provides information for contributors, developers, and users of this project repo.

### Quick Tip - View the Website Locally

See [GITHUB_PAGES.md](GITHUB_PAGES.md) for information on viewing the site locally with `jekyll`.

### We use the "Developer Certificate of Origin" (DCO).

> [!WARNING]
> Before you make any git commits with changes, understand what's required for DCO.

See the Alliance contributing guide [section on DCO](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#developer-certificate-of-origin) for details. In practical terms, supporting this requirement means you must use the `-s` flag with your `git commit` commands.
