# Getting to Know MCP and Its Ecosystem

This section provides introductions to aspects of the MCP ecosystem.

## MCP and Everyone Else: a Review of Inter-agent Communication Protocols

In [MCP and Everyone Else - A Review of Inter-agent Communication Protocols](mcp-and-everyone-else/), [Laurie Voss](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seldo/){:target="linkedin"} reprises his [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqB_xML1SfA){:target="youtube"} at the [MCP Developers Summit](https://luma.com/mcpdevsummit2025){:target="mcp-dev-summit"}. He provides an overview of several other inter-agent communication protocols out there that compete with or possibly complement MCP, along with his thoughts about how the ecosystem will evolve.

## Coming Soon

We plan to include chapters on the following topics:

* A quick introduction to MCP
* A dive into MCP under the hood
* Natural Language Interaction Protocol (NLIP) and MCP - ServiceNow and Aitomatic
* The MCP roadmap
