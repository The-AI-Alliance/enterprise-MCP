# Getting to Know MCP and Its Ecosystem

This section provides introductions to aspects of the MCP ecosystem. The following chapters are currently available.

## MCP and Everyone Else: a Review of Inter-agent Communication Protocols

In [MCP and Everyone Else - A Review of Inter-agent Communication Protocols](mcp-and-everyone-else/), [Laurie Voss](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seldo/){:target="linkedin"} reprises his [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqB_xML1SfA){:target="youtube"} at the [MCP Developers Summit](https://luma.com/mcpdevsummit2025){:target="mcp-dev-summit"}. He provides an overview of several other inter-agent communication protocols out there that compete with or possibly complement MCP, along with his thoughts about how the ecosystem will evolve.

## NLIP, Agents, and Protocols

In [NLIP, Agents, and Protocols]({{site.baseurl}}/getting-to-know-mcp/nlip/), [Tom Sheffler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-sheffler/){:target="linkedin"} provides an overview of NLIP and the problems it addresses. [NLIP (Natural Language Interaction Protocol)](https://github.com/nlip-project){:target="_blank"} defines a payload format for transferring natural language conversations augmented with multimodal media. Its intended use is as a transport between a user-facing application and an agent, or between two agents.  NLIP has defined bindings for for many protocols, including MCP, A2A, HTTP, and others. 

## Coming Soon

We plan to include chapters on the following topics:

* A quick introduction to MCP
* A dive into MCP under the hood
* The MCP roadmap
