# Developing MCP Servers: Tools, Techniques, and Design Patterns

This section contains chapters about how to write effective MCP servers, including experience reports, tools to consider, and other guidance. Here is a summary of these chapters.

## Building a Deep Research Agent Using MCP-Agent

In [Building a Deep Research Agent Using MCP-Agent](deep-research-mcp-agent/), [Sarmad Qadri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarmadqadri/){:target="_blank"}, Co-founder and CEO at LastMile AI, and creator of [`mcp-agent`](https://github.com/lastmile-ai/mcp-agent){:target="mcp-agent"}, takes us through his learning process as he designed capabilities into `mcp-agent` to support orchestration of _deep research_ workflows.

## Coming Soon

We plan to include chapters on the following topics:

* What makes a good MCP server?
* Testing and debugging MCP servers.
* Data stores as MCP servers: relational, documents, knowledge graphs, oh my!
